# agile-final-project
This is the final project required under the IBM Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum
In this scenario, you will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, you will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, you will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, you will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.

**SPRINT REVIEW**
Completed core endpoints for the product's catalog. Ideated and implemented testing components, and hosted the product through Github for progress. Burndown chart showcased the flow and following sprints are prioritising key features for product and potential review/cloud procedures.

**BURNDOWN CHART**
A manual track was done for the Github interface as it doesn't contain Burndown Chart Features. The sprint presented a consistent burn-down of 3-4 stories iteratively moving from one component to another before reaching to the Done phase, and closing the milestone.
A final story was placed in 'In Progress', reflecting Agile's consistent developments
